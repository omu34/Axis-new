                     Whatsapp has really revolutionized communication.

                     As of January 2022, data from Statista shows that it is one of the most used apps even ahead of Facebook Messenger.

                     Interestingly, according to a 2020 report on Statista, Kenya led in the number of Whatsapp users globally.

                     This is against its digital population.

                     Yes, you read that right.

                     Globally.

                     97% of Kenya’s digital population is using the messaging app.

                     As a business owner, you need to leverage the popularity of this app by allowing your customers to chat and ask questions on it.

                     I am sure that by now, you have a Whatsapp business number that customers can reach you through, right?

                     If you don’t, you seriously need one.

                     Why?

                     Because according to a Whatsapp blog in 2020, most users of the messaging app wish to “message a business to get help and they’re more likely to make a purchase when they can do so.”

                     But what if you have a plethora of Whatsapp messages coming to your business number?

                     How do you manage all of them?

                     They could be business location requests, reviews about your products, people asking for guidance on how to use your products or just someone getting to familiarize with your business.

                     All these are either potential leads and regular clients needing answers and you do not want to ignore them, do you?

                     You surely don’t.

                     At the same time, it might prove to be a hard task if you rely on the old Whatsapp platform on your smartphone to manage all these requests.
